# Three.js + GSAP

I was interested in adding some 3D element to a website, Three.js is the stack for that and with the addition of GSAP, making animation on a DOM element become pretty concise.

Currently, the 3D model is from sketchfab

Work well on chrome and edge but not responsive yet. Somehow on firefox it doesn't work and instead it tries to download the 3D model on the first load.

Demo : https://threejs-gsap-build.vercel.app/

Note : 

- If you don't see the 3D model, it may still in process of downloading, in about a minute it should appear
- Planning to add preloader in the future
